This application is created with Ionic in Angular Framework.
In order to run the application, you might need to install npm, Angular, and any other necessary things. 
Then, you can start the application by calling "ionic serve" to open the application on the local server. 
Plsese refer to the instruction beloew.

Instruction:
1. Clone the repository locally
2. Run "npm install"
3. Run "npm install -g @angular/cli"
4. Run "ionic serve" (It might take some time to start the server)
5. Since free versions of API only allows temporaty access, the application might encounter "No Access-Control-Allow-Origin" problem. 
In order to solve this issue, we added https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ in front of our API URL. 
We can access API, however, it is only temporary access. Thus, we have to go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo website to request temporary access after a while.

Please let us know if there are any issues running the code. Thank you.
